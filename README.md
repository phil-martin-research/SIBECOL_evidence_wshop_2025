# SIBECOL/AEET 2025 'Evidence synthesis in ecology' workshop
This is a place with resources for the workshop I am running on evidence synthesis in ecology as part of the SIBECOL/AEET 2025 conference.

## Tools

### How to choose what kind of evidence synthesis to do

* [Right review](https://whatreviewisrightforyou.knowledgetranslation.net/) - This tool is designed to provide guidance and supporting material on methods for the conduct and reporting of knowledge synthesis.
* [MAGICKS](https://ksm-eklipse.shinyapps.io/MAGICKS/) - This is a decision support tool which will guide you to choose methods for your knowledge synthesis needs

### Deduplicating searches
* [synthesisr R package](https://github.com/mjwestgate/synthesisr) - This tool allows you to run semi-automated deduplication in R
* [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai/) - The Rayyan platform for screening papers also has a deduplication feature, but is not open source

### Screening papers
* [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai/) - One of the best platforms for screening papers, although it requires a paid subscription to get the best features. It works well for distributed teams.
* [Metagear R package](https://github.com/cran/metagear/tree/master) - An open source R tool for screening (and more).
